RenderLoadingPage
A static site designed for the Render free tier to display a loading message while your web app starts up. Once the web app is ready, it automatically redirects to your application.

Features
Customizable Loading Message: Easily update the loading message to match your app's theme or branding.
Automatic Redirection: Seamlessly redirects to your web app as soon as it’s ready.
Lightweight and Fast: Utilizes minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for quick loading.
Open Source: Free to use and adapt for your projects.
Why Use RenderLoadingPage?
The Render free tier often experiences cold starts, which can cause delays before your app becomes accessible. This project enhances user experience by displaying a friendly loading message rather than an empty screen or error.

How It Works
Access the loading page by using the following URL format:

css
Copy code
render-loader.onrender.com?site=[YOUR_RENDER_SITE_NAME]
Replace [YOUR_RENDER_SITE_NAME] with your Render app’s name (omit the domain). For example, if your app's URL is example.onrender.com, use render-loader.onrender.com?site=example.

The page will periodically check if your app is ready and automatically redirect users once it becomes accessible.

Installation and Setup
Clone or fork this repository if you wish to host your own version:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RenderLoadingPage.git
Customize the index.html file if needed (e.g., update the loading message or behavior).
Deploy the static site to any hosting provider (e.g., Render, Netlify, or Vercel).
Alternatively, use the provided URL format to directly use the hosted version.
